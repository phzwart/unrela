# UnReLa (Universal Relation Language)

UnReLa is an implementation-independent algebra for spatial reasoning. 

### The Core Thesis:
Current spatial AI confuses perception (pixels) with logic (relations). UnReLa provides a mathematical "interlingua" where objects are defined by their boundaries and metrics, and relationships are calculated via a strictly defined algebraic set of primitives.

## Repository Structure:
- **/spec**: Machine-readable definitions (YAML/JSON).
- **/docs**: The foundational whitepaper and mathematical proofs.
- **/prompts**: LLM-directed directives for spatial reasoning.
- **/examples**: Domain-specific ontologies (Medical, Robotics, etc).
